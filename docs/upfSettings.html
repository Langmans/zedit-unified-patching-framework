<p>The UPF settings tab allows you to open the <a href="docs://Modal Views/Manage Patchers Modal">Manage Patchers Modal</a> or reload patchers from disk.</p>

<p>You can reload UPF patchers by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> when a modal view is not active.</p>

<p class="neutral-fg"><b>Note:</b> reloading patchers does not update patcher settings changes, including GUI changes to your patcher's settings tab in the Manager Patchers Modal.</p>
