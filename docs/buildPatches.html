<h1>Build Patches Tab</h1>

<p>The build patches tab allows you to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create new patch plugins</li>
    <li>Rename patch plugins</li>
    <li>Assign patchers to different patch plugins</li>
    <li>Disable individual patchers</li>
    <li>Build individual patch plugins</li>
    <li>Build all patch plugins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Patch plugins</h2>
<p>With UPF, the results of multiple patchers can be generated in a single plugin.  In this documentation, we use the term "patch plugin" to refer to a plugin which is generated by one or more patchers.</p>

<h3>Creating patch plugins</h3>
<p>You can click the <b>Add Plugin</b> button to create a new patch plugin.</p>

<h3>Renaming patch plugins</h3>
<p>You can edit a patch plugin's filename by clicking on it.  <b>NOTE:</b> most tools require plugin filenames to end in a known extension such as .esp or .esl.</p>

<h3>Building patching plugins</h3>
<p>You can click the <b>Build</b> button to build a patch plugin.  <b>NOTE:</b> If the patch plugin is loaded it will be nuked - all records, groups, and masters will be removed from it.  If the plugin is not loaded but exists in your game data folder it will be deleted.</p>

<p>You can build all patch plugins by clicking the <b>Build All</b> button.</p>

<h3>Deleting patch plugins</h3>
<p>Patch plugins which have no patchers assigned to them will be automatically removed from the manage patchers modal when you close it.</p>

<h2>Patchers</h2>

<h3>Toggling individual patchers</h3>
<p>You can disable/enable individual patchers by toggling their corresponding checkbox.  Disabled patchers will not be run when the patch plugin they are assigned to is built.</p>

<h3>Disabled patchers</h3>
<p>Patchers will be disabled if a required file is not loaded or is unavailable to the patch plugin it is assigned to due to load order.  Disabled patchers will appear red, and will display a tooltip explaining why they were disabled when you hover over them.</p>

<h3>Assigning patchers to patch plugins</h3>
<p>You can move a patcher to a different patch plugin using drag and drop.</p>
